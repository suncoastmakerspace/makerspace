Hello everybody and welcome!

This is the Suncoast Drone github repository. We will begin work here focusing on the different aspects of the drone, but primarily the computer science part. We're going to need a COMPUTER VISION algorithm for this to identify rust, and the other particularates.

The computer vision algorithm(CVA) we plan on installing outside Mr. Penserga's door is going to be something we'll do as a first version iteration of this, after all it's just a CVA on a drone.
